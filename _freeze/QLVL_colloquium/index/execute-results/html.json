A fresh look at grammatical alternations\". The goal of this research is to examine if and how the way people choose between different ways of saying the same thing (i.e., grammatical alternations) depends on the meaning of the words in the utterance. I will start by introduce you to the dative alternation, our case study, and how lexical semantics is traditionally modeled in variationist linguistics. Then, I will illustrate our proposal, namely automatically-generated semantic predictors using DS techniques, and finally I will discuss the analyses and the results obtained from our first case study using type-level distributional semantic predictors.\n:::\n\n# Introduction: the dative alternation\n\n## The dative alternation\n\n::: {style=\"color: #F39D41;\"}\n1.  **a) Ditransitive** dative variant\n:::\n\n\\[*The waiter*\\]~subject~ \\[*gave*\\]~verb~ \\[*my cousin*\\]~recipient~ \\[*some pizza*\\]~theme~\n\n::: {style=\"color: #F39D41;\"}\n1.  **b) Prepositional** dative variant\n:::\n\n\\[*The waiter*\\]~subject~ \\[*gave*\\]~verb~ \\[*some pizza*\\]~theme~ \\[*to my cousin*\\]~recipient~\n\n::: notes\nLet's dive into our case study. The DA is one of the most investigated cases of grammatical alternation - where we define a GA as \"two or more constructions, called variants, with a highly similar meaning. An A represents choice point for the individual speaker\".\n\nIn English, there are two ways, two variants to encode the dative relation: the ditransitive dative construction (recipient-theme order), and the prepositional dative construction (theme-recipient order).\n:::\n\n## Modelling grammatical alternations\n\nIn previous literature, focus on three kinds of predictors:\n\n1.  **Formal predictors:** e.g., *structural complexity of constituents* (e.g., presence of heavy postmodification), *pronominality*, and *constituent length* (in words, syllables, or similar)\n\n2.  **Information status‐related predictors:** e.g., *givenness*\n\n3.  **Semantic, coarse-grained, higher-level predictors:** e.g., *animacy* (i.e., annotate for a binary distinction between animate and inanimate recipients -- see Bresnan et al. 2007)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\nTo explore the correlation of choices between the two variants are both implemented language-internal predictors as well as language-external predictors (such as sex, race/ethnicity, etc). Regarding the internal predictors, the traditional variationist approach is fairly good at manually annotating for formal predictors, such as in (1) and (2) for the dative alternation, but when it comes to the third point, namely the semantic predictors, the VA would annotate only for few semantic factors such as animacy. This is because (next slide)\n:::\n\n## Role of semantic predictors in alternation predictions\n\n**Annotating for semantics is labor‐intensive and challenging to perform objectively.**\n\n::: {.caption style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"}\n-   *What role do semantic characteristics play in the choice of one of the two variants? At the current state of the research, we know very little about them.*\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; color: #E04836;\"}\n**We assume broad semantic equivalence of dative variants, but we are interested in extent to which semantics of materials in argument slots predicts choice.**\n:::\n\n::: notes\nAnnotating for semantics is labor‐intensive and time-consuming, and it's challenging to perform objectively and systematically. So if we ask ourselves: What role do semantic characteristics play in the choice of one of the two variants? We do not have a clear answer because we are missing those data. And this is the research gap we want to cover.\n\nIn particular, we are interested how much the semantic characteristics of the lexical material in the slots of the dative variants predict the choice.\n:::\n\n# From vectors to predictors\n\n## Automatically-generated semantic predictors\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; color: #E04836;\"}\n**Our suggestion: automatically-generated, corpus-based semantic predictors using distributional semantic models (DSMs).**\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.7em;\"}\n-   New inputs from DMSs: **more data, less annotation**\n\n-   Distributional semantics is an usage-based model of meaning, based on the assumption that items that occur in similar contexts in a given corpus will be semantically similar, while those that occur in different contexts will be semantically different.\n:::\n\n::: notes\n(after reading the slides) DSMs can help us understanding and bring to the light the semantic characteristics of the lexical context in which those variants are embedded. In a nutshell, DS is a usage-based model of meaning, based on the assumption that items that occur in similar contexts in a given corpus will be semantically similar, while those that occur in different contexts will be semantically different. To do that, we operationalize the differences in the distribution of two (or more) items by extracting their co-occurrences from corpora: those differences can tell us something about the semantic relatedness of items.\n:::\n\n## Examples: recipient type-lemmas\n\n::: {style=\"color: #F39D41;\"}\n1.  **DAT-4100**\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"}\n-   \\[*if I*\\]~subject~ \\[*gave*\\]~verb~ \\[*it*\\]~theme~ \\[*to the government*\\]~recipient~ they would just waste it.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"color: #F39D41;\"}\n2.  **DAT-4067**\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"}\n-   \\[*The judge*\\]~subject~ \\[*will usually, uh, give*\\]~verb~ \\[*custody*\\]~theme~ \\[*to the mother*\\]~recipient~ ninety-seven percent of the time.\n:::\n\n::: notes\nBut, what does it mean annotating predictors with DS? What we are going to distributionally model are the recipient and the theme of the alternation.
