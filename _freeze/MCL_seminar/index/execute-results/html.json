(2017). We will investigate the dative alternation in American English by employing two of the traditional statistical techniques in variationist analysis: \\*binomial logistic regression analysis and conditional random forest\\*.\n:::\n\n# Preliminary steps\n\n## 1. Know the linguistic phenomenon you want to analyse\n\n**...and how people how studied it before**\n\nTry to look for:\n\n-   The pivotal study on the phenomenon you want to study\n\n-   A couple of qualitative and quantitative investigations to get a sense of how researchers addressed it before you and what you can integrate to their research: a new approach, a new perspective, new data with a previous approach etc.\n\n## 2. Know your dataset (and your data) {.scrollable}\n\n**...especially if you did not build the dataset by yourselves!**\n\n-   **Linguistic information:**\n\n    -   where are the observations extracted from? and when?\n\n    -   do they belong to a specific language register?\n\n    -   did the authors apply some restrictions/limitations to the dataset?\n\n-   **Statistical information:**\n\n    -   how many observations the dataset counts originally and after restrictions\n\n    -   how many variables/predictors are annotated\n\n        -   Keep always an eye on how much the dataset change after you apply your specific filters\n\n## 2. Know your dataset (and your data)\n\n**...especially if you did not build the dataset by yourselves!**\n\n-   **Language internal/external predictors:** identify and describe them.\n\n    -   *First thing First*: Response variable, type of the variables, levels of the variables\n\n    -   Filters added in previous studies (they can drastically change the results of your replication study!!)\n\n::: notes\nt\n\nWe will see how the number of observation will change during the analysis of our case study.\n:::\n\n## 3. Understand the choice of the analysis\n\n**...based on the research questions and data you have**\n\n-   Why the authors chose to employ this/those analysis/es?\n\n-   Which questions these analyses answer to? Do they address to specific perspectives of the linguistic phenomenon, or they are more general?\n\n-   Did these analyses bring an innovation in terms of methodologies employed in the field? Or they have been already used (see 1)?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# The case study\n\n## Starting point: Szmrecsanyi et al. (2017)\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"}\n[This paper](https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/4948/) investigates two of the well-known alternations in English, **the dative and the genitive alternation** in four varieties of spoken English. \nAn ensemble of statistical analyses is employed to understand the extent to which the probabilistic grammar of genitive and dative variant choice differs across varieties.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.7em;\"}\n-   Our mini-replication study will focus only on **Spoken American English**, and only on the **dative alternation**\n\n-   **Goal** of my analysis is slightly different from the original one: to **get familiar with the so-called *traditional, top-down, manually annotated predictors*** for the dative alternation, and how well they predict the choice between the two variants in spoken American English.\n:::\n\n::: notes\n-   This analysis was the first step in the first case study of my PhD research project.\n:::\n\n## The dative alternation\n\n::: {style=\"color: #F39D41;\"}\n**(1) a. Ditransitive** dative variant\n:::\n\n    \\[*The waiter*\\]~subject~ \\[*gave*\\]~verb~ \\[*my cousin*\\]~recipient~     \\[*some pizza*\\]~theme~\n\n::: {style=\"color: #F39D41;\"}\n   **b. Prepositional** dative variant\n:::\n\n    \\[*The waiter*\\]~subject~ \\[*gave*\\]~verb~ \\[*some pizza*\\]~theme~     \\[*to my cousin*\\]~recipient~\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.7em;\"}\n**What is an alternation?** See [Pijpops (2020)](https://benjamins.com/catalog/bjl.00053.pij) and [Gries (2017)](https://benjamins.com/catalog/bjl.00001.gri).\n:::\n\n::: notes\nLet's dive into our case study.\n\nThe topic of our analysis is the dative alternation in \\*contemporary American\\* English.\n\nThe DA is one of the most investigated cases of grammatical alternation - where we define a SA as \"two or more constructions, called variants, with a highly similar meaning. An A represents choice point for the individual speaker\".\n\nIn English, there are two ways, two variants to encode the dative relation: the ditransitive dative construction (recipient-theme order), and the prepositional dative construction (theme-recipient order).\n:::\n\n## Predicting the DA: the dataset\n\nA core section of every variationist research is the dataset and its annotation: Szmrecsanyi et al. (2017) presents two comprehensive and homogeneously manually annotated [datasets](https://purl.stanford.edu/qj187zs3852) for both alternations.\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"}\n-   The paper offers a **very, very** good and detailed description of the dataset and its construction: read it to get an inspiration for your own study!\n:::\n\n::: notes\nVariationist sociolinguistics puts at the first place the choice for statistical and corpus-based methods in the exploration of language variation. Tagliamonte (2012)reported an immense and suggestive variety of quantitative approaches and statistical tools to use in our research.\n:::\n\n## Predicting the DA: the dataset\n\n**Linguistic information**\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.7em;\"}\n-   The dative tokens for American English were elicited from the **Switchboard corpus of American English** (Godfrey, Holliman & McDaniel 1992), as described in Bresnan et al. (2007). The Switchboard corpus covers telephone conversations collected at the beginning of the 1990s.\n\n-   This dataset contains only observation with the verb ***give*** as verb of the dative construction.\n\n-   The collection follows Bresnan et al. (2007) directions in defining *interchangeable ditransitive and prepositional dative variants*: only instances of the verb *give* with two argument Noun Phrases, with the exception of non-interchangeable contructions, were considered.\n:::\n\n## Predicting the DA: the dataset\n\n**Statistical information**\n\n-   The original dative dataset counts 4136 observations, with the American English section counting **1190 observations**, and a manual annotation for **25 predictors**.\n\n## Predicting the DA: the dataset\n\n**Language-external predictors**\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"}\n-   **Variety**: in our case, US - one level\n-   **Speaker.ID**\n-   **Speaker sex** (only for a subset of observations)\n-   **Speaker year of birth** (only for a subset of observations)\n:::\n\n## Predicting the DA: the dataset\n\n**Language-internal predictors:** the authors annotated for well-known determinants of dative variation.\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.6em;\"}\n-   **Response.variable**: Ditransitive dative versus prepositional dative.\n-   **Recipient/Theme.type:** The annotation distinguishes between the following categories: (1) noun phrase; (2) personal pronoun; (3) demonstrative pronoun; (4) impersonal pronoun.\n-   **Recipient/Theme.definiteness:** The annotation distinguishes between the following categories: (1) definite; (2) indefinite (3) definite proper noun.\n-   **Recipient/Theme.animacy:** The annotation distinguishes between the following categories: (1) human and animal; (2) collective; (3) temporal; (4) locative; (5) inanimate.\n-   **Recipient/Theme.length:** Length of the recipient and theme phrases in orthographically transcribed words.\n-   **Semantics (of dative verb):** (1) transfer; (2) communication; (3) abstract.\n-   **Recipient/Theme.head:** Head lexeme of both the theme and the recipient.\n:::\n\n::: notes\n!! This is not an exhaustive list of the predictors annotated in the dataset, but are those which have been considered for the analysis.\n:::\n\n## Predicting the DA: the dataset\n\n**Language-internal predictors:** further manipulation\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.7em;\"}\n-   Reducing the predictors into binary contrasts: ***Recipient/Theme.type*** were reduced to pronominal (\\[2\\], \\[3\\], \\[4\\]) versus non-pronominal (\\[1\\]); ***Recipient/Theme.definiteness*** were reduced to definite (\\[1\\], \\[3\\]) versus indefinite (\\[2\\]); ***Recipient/Theme.animacy*** were reduced to animate (\\[1\\]) versus inanimate (\\[2\\], \\[3\\], \\[4\\], \\[5\\])\n\n-   Creating a the new predictor ***Length.difference***: the Recipient/Theme.length measures were combined into a relative measure of length, calculated as log(Recipient.length) - log(Theme.length).\n\n-   ***Recipient/Theme.lemma***: the annotated lemma of the heads.\n:::\n\n::: notes\nAnd now let's go to the hands-on part!\n:::\n",
